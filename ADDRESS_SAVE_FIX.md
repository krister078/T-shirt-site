# Address Saving Fix

## Problem Identified
The address saving functionality wasn't working because the `AddressSection.tsx` component was not connected to the database. It had placeholder code that simulated saving but never actually saved to Supabase.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Database Integration**
- Added proper Supabase client integration to `AddressSection.tsx`
- Implemented real database loading and saving functionality
- Added proper error handling

### 2. **Address Loading**
- Added `useEffect` to load existing addresses on component mount
- Addresses now properly populate from the database when the profile page loads
- Added loading state while fetching data

### 3. **Address Saving**
- Implemented proper database insert/update logic
- Addresses are now saved to the `addresses` table in Supabase
- Added success messages and error handling

### 4. **Phone Number Support**
- Added phone number field to the address form
- Updated database schema to include phone numbers
- Phone numbers are now collected and saved with addresses

### 5. **UI Improvements**
- Added loading states for better user experience
- Added success messages when addresses are saved
- Improved form validation and error handling

## Files Modified

### Database Schema
- `add-phone-to-addresses.sql` - Adds phone field to addresses table
- `add-phone-to-orders.sql` - Adds phone field to orders table

### Components
- `src/components/profile/AddressSection.tsx` - Complete rewrite with database integration
- `src/app/checkout/page.tsx` - Added phone number collection
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Updated Address interface to include phone

## How to Test

1. **Run Database Migrations:**
   ```sql
   -- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ALTER TABLE addresses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS phone TEXT;
   ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS shipping_phone TEXT;
   ```

2. **Test Address Saving:**
   - Go to Profile page
   - Click "Edit Address" 
   - Fill in address information including phone number
   - Click "Save Address"
   - Should see success message
   - Refresh the page - address should still be there

3. **Test Checkout Integration:**
   - Add items to cart
   - Go to checkout
   - Address should be pre-filled if saved in profile
   - Enter phone number if not already saved
   - Complete checkout
   - Address should be saved for future use

## Key Improvements

✅ **Real Database Connection**: Addresses are now actually saved to Supabase
✅ **Data Persistence**: Addresses persist between sessions
✅ **Phone Number Support**: Phone numbers are collected and used for shipping labels
✅ **Better UX**: Loading states, success messages, proper error handling
✅ **Checkout Integration**: Saved addresses are used in checkout process

The address saving functionality is now fully working and integrated with the rest of the application!
